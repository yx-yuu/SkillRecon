## Post-Release Verification

### Check npm Package
```bash
npm info knowfun-skills
npm info knowfun-skills dist.tarball
```

### Check GitHub Release
- Verify tag v1.0.13 exists
- Verify release notes are accurate
- Check that README displays correctly

### Check ClawHub Status
- Monitor security scan results
- Respond to any reviewer questions
- Reference CLAWHUB_VERIFICATION.md if needed

## If ClawHub Still Flags

### Automated Scanner Flags
If automated scanners still detect issues:

1. **Review CLAWHUB_VERIFICATION.md** - Share with security team
2. **Request Manual Review** - Explain false positive reasons
3. **Provide Evidence**:
   - Script paths are hardcoded
   - Only official API endpoints called
   - No dangerous commands present
   - Industry standard security practices

### Manual Review Process
Points to emphasize:

1. **Legitimate Service**: Official Knowfun.io API integration
2. **Open Source**: MIT licensed, fully transparent
3. **Security Verified**: All verification steps documented
4. **Similar to Other Skills**: Same pattern as gh, npm, git skills
5. **No Security Risk**: Comprehensive analysis provided

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Version 1.0.13 published to npm
- ✅ Git tag v1.0.13 pushed to GitHub
- ✅ ClawHub security review passed or manual approval received
- ✅ README badges show correct status
- ✅ No functional regressions

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues found:
```bash
# Unpublish from npm (within 72 hours)
npm unpublish knowfun-skills@1.0.13

# Remove git tag
git tag -d v1.0.13
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.13

# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
```

## Notes
