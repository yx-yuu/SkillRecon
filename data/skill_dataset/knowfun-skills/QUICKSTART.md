## Choose Your Platform

| Platform | Install Method | Time |
|----------|----------------|------|
| **Claude Code** | `curl` + copy SKILL.md | ~1 min |
| **Cursor / Cline** | `npm install -g knowfun-skills` | ~30 sec |
| **OpenClaw** | `npx clawhub install knowfun-skills` | ~30 sec |

---

## Step 1: Install

### Claude Code

```bash
# Install the skill globally
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/knowfun
curl -fsSL [Anonymous URL] \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/knowfun/SKILL.md
```

### Cursor / Cline

```bash
npm install -g knowfun-skills
```

### OpenClaw

```bash
npx clawhub install knowfun-skills
```

## Step 2: Get Your API Key (2 minutes)

1. Visit https://www.knowfun.io/api-platform
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a name like "My Development Key"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `kf_`)

---

## Step 3: Configure (30 seconds)

```bash
# Set for current session
export KNOWFUN_API_KEY="kf_your_api_key_here"

# Or persist permanently (recommended)
echo 'export KNOWFUN_API_KEY="kf_your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
knowfun credits
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Available: 1,000 credits
📊 Total Earned: 1,000 credits
📉 Total Used: 0 credits
```

> **Claude Code users**: run `/knowfun credits` inside a Claude Code session.

---

## Step 5: Create Your First Content (2 minutes)

### Claude Code

Ask Claude naturally:
```
Create a Knowfun course about "Introduction to Python"
```

Or use the slash command directly:
```
/knowfun create course "Introduction to Python: variables, loops, and functions"
```

### Cursor / Cline / OpenClaw

```bash
knowfun create course "Introduction to Python"
```

Or tell your AI assistant:
```
Use knowfun to create a course about Python basics
```

## What Happens Next

Your task will be processed in the background. Within 2–5 minutes you'll have a shareable URL.

Check status:
```bash
knowfun status <taskId>
```

Get the result URL:
```bash
knowfun detail <taskId>
```

---

## All Content Types

```bash
knowfun create course "Introduction to Python"
knowfun create poster "Climate Change: Key Facts"
knowfun create game   "Learn JavaScript Variables"
knowfun create film   "History of the Internet"
```

Processing times: posters 1–3 min · courses 2–5 min · games 3–7 min · films 5–10 min

## Check Credits & Schema

```bash
knowfun credits   # Check your balance
knowfun schema    # View all configuration options
knowfun list 10   # Recent tasks
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: knowfun"
```bash
npm install -g knowfun-skills
```

### "API Key not found"
```bash
echo $KNOWFUN_API_KEY          # Check if set
export KNOWFUN_API_KEY="kf_…"  # Set it
```
