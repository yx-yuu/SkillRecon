# AI Task Router

Automatically routes prompts to the cheapest model that can handle them.

## How It Works

Pattern matching classifies tasks into tiers:

| Task Type | Example | Routed To | Cost |
|-----------|---------|-----------|------|
| Simple | "hi", "thanks", "what time is it" | Local (Ollama) | $0 |
| Moderate | "write an email", "analyze this" | Mid-tier (Sonnet) | $ |
| Complex | "debug this codebase", "write a chapter" | Premium (Opus) | $$$ |

## Usage

```javascript
const { TaskRouter } = require('./src/task-router');

const router = new TaskRouter({
  defaultModel: 'local',
  escalationModel: 'sonnet',
  heavyModel: 'opus'
});

const result = router.route('analyze the sales data from Q3');
// { model: 'sonnet', reason: 'Analysis task', confidence: 0.8 }
```

## Custom Rules

Add your own routing patterns:

```javascript
router.addRule({
  name: 'code-review',
  pattern: /\b(review|refactor|debug|optimize)\b.*\b(code|function|class)\b/i,
  model: 'opus',
  reason: 'Code review needs deep reasoning'
});
```

## Cost Savings

Typical usage pattern routes ~70% of tasks to free local models, ~25% to mid-tier, and ~5% to premium. With Opus at $15/M tokens vs Ollama at $0, this saves 60-80% on API costs.
